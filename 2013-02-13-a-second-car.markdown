Before I started working from home, we often found ourselves having scheduling conflicts around our single car.  I started using my bike much more at the end of last summer and plan to continue as the snow lets up in the spring, but sometimes you have to go the extra distance and for most people that involves a second car.

I recently discovered that Google was now providing [transit] directions in Thunder Bay.  This is arguably the best thing to happen to transit in a long time.  No longer do I have to consider planning a bus trip.  Now I can sit on the couch and pull out my phone and know instantly how long it will take me to get where I want to go.  I realize this is old news for people in larger centres, but it’s basically a second car that costs a fraction of the price.  Or a first car.  Why not pull out your phone just before you get in your car and see how long the bus will take?  It’s very likely that it may only be an extra few minutes over the car trip and will save you money and let you relax.
