I grew up in Northwestern Ontario where I studied for my CS degree at [Lakehead University](https://lakeheadu.ca). After touring with my [band](http://unmode.ca) for a few years and starting a family my wife and I moved to Montr√©al. My major interests are music, design and especially urban design, economics, and the intersection between technology and quality-of-life. When I'm not working at [TBT Engineering](https://tbte.ca) I enjoy spending time with my wife and daughters and traveling with family and friends.
